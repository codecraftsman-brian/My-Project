# React Frontend Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the React frontend for the TikTok Scheduler application:

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm 6.x or higher

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

If you don't have Node.js installed:

### Windows/macOS:
1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](  )
2. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager)

### Linux:
```bash
# Using nvm (recommended)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 16  # Install Node.js 16

# Or using apt (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

This will install all the packages defined in package.json, including:
- React and React DOM
- Material UI and icons
- Axios for API calls
- Date-fns for date manipulation
- Recharts for charts
- Crypto-JS for client-side encryption

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Step 4: Run the Development Server

```bash
# Start the React development server
npm start
```

The application will start running at http://localhost:3000.

## Step 5: Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
# Create a production build
npm run build
```

This creates a `build` directory with optimized production files.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Make sure all dependencies are installed
npm install
```

### Port conflicts
If port 3000 is already in use, React will ask to use a different port. Type 'Y' to accept.

### API connection issues
Ensure the backend server is running at http://localhost:5000, or update the REACT_APP_API_URL in .env.
