Usage Guide
1. Initial Setup
The first time you run the application, you'll need to configure it:

Click on the Settings button in the top right corner
Enter your Telegram API credentials:

API ID: Get from https://my.telegram.org/apps
API Hash: Get from https://my.telegram.org/apps
Phone Number: Your Telegram account phone number with country code (e.g., +1234567890)


Configure timing settings:

Minimum Wait Time: Minimum minutes to wait between batches of messages
Maximum Wait Time: Maximum minutes to wait between batches of messages


Click Save Settings

2. Adding Messages
You can add messages in two ways:
Individual Messages:

Enter your message in the "Add New Message" text area
Click Add Message

Bulk Upload:

Create a text file (.txt) or CSV file (.csv) with one message per line
Use the "Upload Messages" section to upload your file

3. Adding Targets
Targets can be users, groups, or channels that will receive your messages:
Individual Targets:

Fill in the "Add New Target" form:

Name: A friendly name to identify the target
Username/ID: The Telegram username or ID
Type: Select user, group, or channel


Click Add Target

Bulk Upload:

Create a CSV file with format: name,id,type (one per line)
Example:
John Doe,@johndoe,user
Marketing Group,@marketing_group,group
News Channel,@news_channel,channel

Use the "Upload Targets" section to upload your file

4. Running the Scheduler
Once you've configured the application and added messages and targets:

Click the Start Scheduler button
The first time you run it, you'll need to authenticate with Telegram:

A modal will appear asking for the verification code sent to your Telegram account
If you have 2FA enabled, you'll also need to enter your password



5. Managing the Scheduler

Stop Scheduler: Click to stop sending messages
Reset Cycle: Click to start a new messaging cycle (all targets will receive messages again)
You can see whether the scheduler is running from the status indicator

How It Works

The scheduler randomly selects messages from your list
It sends these messages to 1-4 random targets at a time
It ensures no target receives a second message until all targets have received one (completing a cycle)
Messages are sent at random intervals between your minimum and maximum wait times

Troubleshooting

Authentication Issues: If you have trouble authenticating, check that your API credentials are correct
Connection Problems: Ensure you have an active internet connection
Messages Not Sending: Verify that your targets exist and are accessible by your account
Application Not Starting: Check that all required packages are installed and files are in the correct locations

Data Storage
The application creates several files to store your data:

data/config.json: Stores your API credentials and timing settings
data/messages.json: Stores your messages and targets
data/sent_log.json: Tracks which targets have received messages in each cycle
